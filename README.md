I built a Dynamic project management board that lets you move, drag, and drop tasks from one late to another using the HTML5 Drag and drop API. 

> The data flow of this application is handled using local state and life cycles and determines which tasks ae displayed in the different lanes. 

This applicatin also uses the the advance React pattern of custom hooks. With Custom Hooks, you can reuse state logic in fuction components across your applications.
